>DecoTengu is Python dive decompression library to experiment with various
implementations of the [Buhlmann decompression model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÃ¼hlmann_decompression_algorithm) with Erik Baker's gradient
factors (other decompression models might be possible in the future).

>The results of DecoTengu calculations are decompression stops and tissue
saturation information. Third party applications can use those results for
data analysis purposes or dive planning functionality.

>The DecoTengu library is licensed under terms of GPL license, version 3, see
[COPYING](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/decotengu.git/plain/COPYING)
file for details. As stated in the license, there is no warranty, so any
diving while using data provided by the library is on diver's own risk.

### *Note about this fork*
*Aug. 3, 2016*
This repository is simply a fork of the original repo, which happens not to be on GitHub.
Since the code is GPL licensed, and since I like to mess with code, I forked it here.
To see the original repository, go to the [source code](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/decotengu.git) link above.
Please do not submit issues for the primary code base here-- instead contact the original author as instructed at the links above.

My goal with this fork is simply to make some plots about diving to understand the physics of recreational diving better.

Cheers,
gully
